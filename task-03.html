<h2 style="color : red; text-decoration : underline; font-size : 40px ; line-height :20px;">METHOD :</h2>
<p style="color : orange ; font-style : italic ; text-decoration : underline;">
We trained this model using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), using the same methods as InstructGPT, 
but with slight differences in the data collection setup.<br>
We trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning: human AI trainers provided conversations in which they played both side the user and an AI assistant.
We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses.<br> 
We mixed this new dialogue dataset with the InstructGPT dataset, which we transformed into a dialogue format.</p>
<p style="color : orange ; font-style : italic ; font-size : 30px ; line height : 10px ; text-decoration : underline;">
ChatGPT is fine-tuned from a model in the GPT-3.5 series, which finished training in early 2022. You can learn more about the 3.5 series here.
ChatGPT and GPT 3.5 were trained on an Azure AI supercomputing infrastructure.</p>
<h2 style="color : red ; text-decoration : underline ; font-size : 40px ; line-height : 20px;">LIMITATION :</h2>
<p style="color : green ; font-style : italic ; text-decoration : underline;"> 
    ChatGPT sometimes writes plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. Fixing this issue is challenging, as: 
(1) during RL training, there  currently no source of truth.<br> 
(2) training the model to be more cautious causes it to decline questions.
that it can answer correctly; and.<br> 
(3) supervised training misleads the model because the ideal answer depends on what the model knows, rather than what the human demonstrator knows.</p>
<p style="color : green ; font-style : italic ; text-decoration : underline;">
ChatGPT is sensitive to tweaks to the input phrasing or attempting the same prompt multiple times.
 For example, given one phrasing of a question, 
the model can claim to not know the answer, but given a slight rephrase, can answer correctly.</p>

<p style="color : brown ; text-decoration : underline ; font-style : italic">
        Today research release of ChatGPT is the latest step in OpenAI  iterative deployment of increasingly safe and useful AI systems. 
Many lessons from deployment of earlier models like GPT-3 and Codex have informed.<br>
the safety mitigations in place for this release  including substantial reductions in harmful and untruthful 
outputs achieved by the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). </p>
<h2 style="color : red ; text-decoration : underline ; font-size : 40px ; line-height : 20px;">THE FUTURE OF CHAT GPT :</h2>
<p style="color : violet ; text-decoration : underline ; font-style : italic;">
 In recent years Chat GPT technology has been making waves in various industries. 
It has the potential to streamline roles and fundamentally change how people create value.<br> 
At the same time there are concerns about its impact on human employment.
 Lets explore some of the use cases of Chat GPT  its future and whether or not you should be worried.
<h2 style="color : red ; text-decoration : underline ; font- size : 40px ; line-height : 20px;">THE CHAT GPTs IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT :</h2>
<p style="color : blue ; text-decoration : underline ; font-style : italic;">
I dared to ask Chat GPT what the worst possible outcome of Chat GPT implementation for human employment is
This is the answer I received:The worst possible outcome of Chat GPT implementation for human employment is 
job loss due to automation and AI-powered systems becoming more capable of performing tasks previously done
by humans.<br> This could lead to a decrease in demand for certain jobs as well as a shift in the skills and expertise 
required for others.<br>However it is important to note that AI can also create new job opportunities and that its impact
on employment will likely be complex and multifaceted.<br>Additionally, proactive steps can be taken to mitigate any  
negative effects such as providing education and training for workers to acquire new skills and adapt to changing job markets.

<p style="color : sky ; text-decoration : underline ; font-style : italic;">
With all this talk about the future of Chat GPT  you may be reaching for a copy of Aldus Huxleys Brave New World or George Orwell 1984.<br>
Instead of fearing the future of Chat GPT and dwelling on a dystopian view that technology will replace all human jobs.<br>
it important to remember that technology can bring both opportunities and challenges. While it may displace certain jobs<br>
it can also create new ones and open up exciting career paths. If you have enjoyed this article you may also want to look through our blog on the future
